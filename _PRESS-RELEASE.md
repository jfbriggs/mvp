There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## MyLeague ##

## Recreational sports league management for league directors and team captains. ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

## Summary ##
  > MyLeague is a recreational sports league management application which provides an organized and feature-rich way for league managers and team captains to keep up-to-date rosters, individual player information, game schedules and statistics throughout a season.

## Problem ##
  > Professional athletes aside, people take part in recreational sports for fun, exercise, and camaraderie.  However, there exist no clean & easy-to-use solutions for managing teams, schedules, and statistics without either great expense or a major time investment in data upkeep.

## Solution ##
  > MyLeague provides a simple interface that allows for league standings at-a-glance, quick statistics updating, and providing information regarding up-to-date rosters, player information, league rules, etc.  As a league manager, simply input completed game information, and the stats are disseminated to the appropriate places (team records, player stats, etc).  As a team captain, updating a roster is as simple as visiting your team's page and using the add/remove player form.

## Quote from The Team ##
  > "Running a rec league or leading a team shouldn't require more work than is absolutely necessary, and MyLeague promotes this philosophy from the core.  We say, 'keep it simple.'"

## How to Get Started ##
  > League manager?  Simply populate the league overview page with the necessary teams.  Then, visit the schedule page and add scheduled games.  Team captain?  Visit your team's profile to update rosters and view team statistics.  Need to add a player?  Just use the form on your team's page!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "When I used to manage our local adult soccer league, I spent way too much time on manual data entry using an interface that made me want to cry.  MyLeague helps me spend more time actually running the league, and less time updating the web portal."
